# Getting Started with Django-React-RotatingShapes

It is a fullstack React-Django Project. The project structure comprises of backend and frontend. Create a virtual environment from the backend\requirements.txt.

In the backend directory, run:
# `python manage.py runserver`

In the frontend directory, run:
# `npm run start`

# The Django backend creates an endpoint that generates the random values and sends them to frontend through websocket - that is interpreted as cube width/cylinder height/sphere radius.
